Today, we will build a text-based adventure game*. This
involves writing a program that accepts text commands,
interprets those commands, acts upon them, and reports the
results back to the player. For example:

  > python3 adventure.py

  Welcome to the micro-world of CS 61A! You have a midterm tomorrow,
  and in hopes of doing well, you quest to seek Werdna, a mythical
  TA who is rumoured to hold the key to besting the test.

  You arrive in 271 Soda. The room is bright
  and miserable as always. A few 61A students
  are scattered among the lab computers, working
  on the latest project.
  Exits:
  out - Hearst Ave.

  adventure> help
  There are 7 possible operators
  look
  go
  take
  give
  examine
  ask
  help

  adventure> look

  You look around. You see
  A rubber ducky

  adventure> take rubber ducky
  You take the rubber ducky

  adventure> examine rubber ducky

  Hm. It's yellow and it's rubber and it squeaks. Fascinating.

  adventure> go out

  You leave 2nd floor Soda though the exit all the cool kids use
  You find yourself on the sidewalk of Hearst Ave.
  Exits:
  north - 271 Soda
  west - Euclid Ave.
  south - Campus

At a high level, this is exactly what an interpeter does.

Why are we doing this? Because traditionally, all the interpreter based
exercises in 61A have either been "write a calculator" OR "write an
programming language interpreter". Hopefully this livens things up.

        ++ 01 - Intepreters (10~15 minutes) ++
===================================================

An interpreter is a program that allows you to interact
with the computer in a certain language. It understands the
expressions that you type in through that language, and perform
the corresponding actions in some way, usually using an underlying
language.

For example, scalc.py lets you interact with the computer
in a simple calculator language. It is written in Python.
In Project 4, you will write a Scheme interpreter in Python
as well. Python itself is written in the C programming language.
The computer itself uses hardware to interpret machine code,
a series of ones and zeros that represent basic operations like
adding numbers, loading information from memory, etc.

When you talk about an interpreter, there are two languages that
are at work:
  1. The language being interpreted. We also call this the language
    being implemented. In the first three examples above, the calc
    language, Scheme, and Python, respectively.
  2. The underlying implementation language. From above, Python,
    Python, and C respectively.

Note that the underlying language need not be different from the implementing
language. In the previous incarnation of 61A, students were introduced to a
Scheme interpreter written in Scheme*.  CS61A in Summer 2012 covered a Python
interpreter** written in Python!  This idea is called Metacircular Evaluation.

* For those interested, see:
http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node77.html

** For those interested, the slides are here:
http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su12/lec/week06/lec23-4pp.pdf
You'll have to ask a TA to see the accompanying code (or dig around!)


Each interpreter has four parts:
 - Parser - takes in user input (string) and turns it into
     a sequence that the underlying language understands.
 - Evaluator - takes in the aforementioned sequence and interprets it
     accordingly to the rules of the language. The evaluator may call
     apply to apply an evaluated operator to its evaluated operands.
 - Apply - applies the operator to the argument values. Apply may
     call the evaluator to do more work... this is possibly the most
     important example of Tree Recursion. Ever.
 - Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL for short) - the loop that waits for user
     input, passes it to the parser and then the evaluator, and then
     prints out the result.

Here's how all the pieces fit together:
              ____________________________________________
              |                                           |
              |____     _________     __________    ______|
User Input -->|Read|--> | Parser |--> |Evaluator|-->|Print|--> Output
              |____|    |________|    |_________|   |_____|
              |                       __^_v____           |
              ^                      |Apply    |          v
              ^ REPL                 |_________|          v
              |___________________________________________|

Now let's explore how these parts work together in an
adventure game!


        ++ 10 - adventure.py (40~60 minutes) ++
===================================================

We can implement our adventure language in Python3 by completing
the interpreter(/game engine) in adventure.py.

First, here's an explanation of the the two files we were given:

- adventure.py
This file includes the skeleton code of the game engine that you will
complete. There are also classes (Person, Place, Thing) that model
objects in the game. Your engine and the game data uses these.

- cs61a_world.py
All the game data that makes things interesting is in this file.
It creates Persons, Places, and Things that make up the adventure world.

Now, let's look at the base code in adventure.py.
There's a lot of code to take in at once, but don't freeze up!
We'll walk through and implement everything, function by function.

adventure - our REPL. This function reads player input, calls
  adv_parse to get an expression out (represented as a tuple),
  and then calls adv_eval to perform the actions. It prints
  the results accordingly. Then it makes a recursive call to
  itself in order to take in the next command.

The player is represented as a Person object. The interpreter will
allow the player to move the Person through the game and interact with
the various aspects of the world.

You can try to run it by doing
  >>> python3 adventure.py
However it's missing functionality, so nothing will really work.

Let's fix that, shall we?


+++ EXERCISE 1 (10~15 minutes) +++
----------------------------------
NOTE: WHEN YOU WANT TO TRY A DOCTEST. MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN PYTHON.
Here's how:

  > python3 -i adventure.py
  adventure> {Control-d}
  >>> adv_parse('look') # Now you can call adv_parse

Remember that when you run adventure.py, you are talking to
the adventure program, which will evaluate your input in terms
of the adventure code. In order to talk to Python again, you
kill the adventure program by doing Ctrl-d.

ALTERNATIVELY, if the above didn't work (Ctrl-d takes you out of
the entire interpreter)
  > python3
  >>> from adventure import *
  >>> from cs61a_world import *
  >>> adv_parse('look')

Let's start things off by implementing parsing. We do this in
adv_parse - our Parser. Since our game language is simple,
  we're going to do the lexical (turn line into tokens)
  and syntactic analysis (turn tokens into expression)
  all in one function. Our expression representation is
  tuple (No ADT here). Here is the basic syntax of a command:
        [operator] [operand]
  When we encounter a command that matches this syntax, return:
        ([operator], [operand])
  Another common syntax is:
        [operator]
  The corresponding expression is:
        ([operator], '')

For example,

adv_parse('take cookie') returns ('take', 'cookie')
'take' is the operator
'cookie' is the operand

adv_parse('look') returns ('look', '').
'look' is the operator
'' is the operand

adv_parse('take rubber ducky') returns ('take', 'rubber ducky')
'take' is the operator
'rubber ducky' is the operand

Most of our operators follow this syntax.
There are two commands that require a different handling:
  ask - when you encounter a line like 'ask Leonard for sushi',
    return ('ask', 'Leonard', 'sushi')

  give - when you encounter a line like 'give a cookie to Andrew',
    return ('give', 'a cookie', 'Andrew')

In this case, ask and give are Special Forms, commands that will
require special case handling in adv_eval later.

HINT: consider the following example:
  >>> x = 'take rubber ducky'
  >>> y = x.split()
  >>> y
  ['take', 'rubber', 'ducky']
  >>> y.pop(0)
  'take'
  >>> y
  ['rubber', 'ducky']
  >>> ' '.join(y[0:]) # Google 'python3 string join'
  'rubber ducky'


+++ EXERCISE 2 (10~15 minutes) +++
----------------------------------
adv_eval - our Evaluator. We want to handle all kinds of expressions.
  For example (assuming you've loaded cs61a_world and adventure):

  >>> Place.current = SodaHall
  >>> adv_eval(adv_parse('take rubber ducky'))
  'Player 1 takes the rubber ducky'
  >>> place = WerdnasHouse
  >>> adv_eval(adv_parse('give rubber ducky to Werdna'))
  'Werdna takes the rubber ducky'

NOTE: YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TEST THIS UNTIL YOU FINISH EXERCISE 3.

adv_eval is truly where the action is. It takes the expression
that is passed in and performs the correct action based on the rules
of our game language.

HINT: Use recursion and also the functions defined right under adv_eval
(adv_apply, look, give, take, etc.) Also take a look at scalc.py*.
Also bug TAs.

It was mentioned before that give and ask are handled specially.
This is because they do not follow the [operator] [operand] pattern.

* http://composingprograms.com/examples/scalc/scalc.html


+++ EXERCISE 3 (5 minutes) +++
---------------------------------
adv_apply - our apply. Handles the application of the normal commands
  Since our commands are simple, adv_apply just needs to apply the
  operator to the operand. There are no calls to adv_eval (there
  aren't any subexpressions to evaluate!)

The point of apply becomes more apparent with more complicated
languages. However the princple holds--apply takes care of the
function calls that are evaluated without any special rules.

HINT: This is really straightfoward. Don't overthink it.

AT THIS POINT YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME! :D


+++ EXERCISE 4 (15 minutes) +++
-------------------------------
One thing that would be useful is to figure out what's in our
inventory. For example:

  adventure> take rubber ducky
  Player 1 takes the rubber ducky
  adventure> stuff
  You look through your stuff... you see
  rubber ducky - Hm. It's yellow and it's rubber and it squeaks. Fascinating.
  -- End of stuff --

Add code to take care of this. What needs to be modified?
Does adv_eval and/or adv_apply need to be modified at all?


+++ EXERCISE 5 (10 minutes) +++
-------------------------------
Now that you've implemented this interpreter, you can play the game!

  > python3 adventure.py

Happy Questing!


        ++ 11 - Conclusion (5 minutes) ++
===================================================

Hope this lab was fun. :)
Since the game is simple, some parts of the lab are toy-ish.
However, the game is still strong and robust enough to be extended;
feel free to add more places, people and things! :P
This also speaks to how powerful Python is as a language,
to allow us to create a full game in relatively short time!
(The original TA might have hacked this lab together in a night...)

Lab 09 Takeaways:
+ Interpreters allow us to directly interact with the computer
    through a language.
+ Interpreters are made of a REPL, a parser, an evaluator, and an
    apply'er. They interact with each other in specific ways.
+ There are two languages when talking about an interpreter:
    the underlying language vs language being implemented.
+ Special forms have their own rules for being evaluted.
    They don't get handled in apply.
+ In adventure.py, the adventure game language is interpreted by
    the Python program. You talk to the computer in adventure talk
    which gets translated to actions in the underlying Python language.
- No tree recursion between adv_eval and adv_apply: our
    simple game language doesn't need it.

In Project 4, you will implement a Scheme interpreter in Python.
... You should start that now!!!
