    <title>CS61A Spring 2014: Submitting Assignments</title>
     </head>

<h1>CS61A Tutorial: Submitting Assignments</h1>

<p>Here is a simple guide that will help you submit all your assignments
for CS61A. Don't worry: it's easy!</p>

<h3 class="section_title">The Basics</h3>

<p>Before we begin to submit an assignment, we need to check for a few things:
<ol>
    <li>We are logged into our CS61A account (i.e. <code>cs61a-bh</code>).</li>
    <li>We have the files we need to submit in our account.</li>
    <li>We know what assignment we are supposed to submit.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>To submit assignments for this class, we will use a simple command line program
called&mdash;wait for it&mdash;<code>submit</code>. To start submitting an assignment,
type <code>submit</code>, followed by the name of the assignment.
When we are at the prompt, we should see something like this:
<pre>
star [16] ~/hw1 # submit hw1
</pre>
This means that we are currently in our homework 1 directory, indicated by <code>~/hw1</code>, and that we are submitting the assignment <code>hw1</code>, the first homework assignment.

<br/><br/>

Tap <code>return</code> and you should then see
<pre>
Enter you and your partner's gmail addresses.
Enter '.' to stop.
GMail:
</pre>
Enter email addresses one at a time, by typing and hitting <code>Enter</code> after each one.
When you have entered each of them, the system will prompt for GMail again.
At this point, please type <code>'.'</code> and <code>Enter</code>.  It is fine if you and your
partner only want to provide one email address; just note that only that email address will
have access to the code review system.</p>

<p> The system will prompt for section numbers, and then logins (the <b>complete</b> login: cs61a-__), in the same way as before.
You'll be fine!  Just follow the same process as for the gmail addresses.  If working alone, you need only
input one of each.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: For the section numbers,
we only need the last two digits (eg. if your discussion is 122 and your lab is 022, just type <code>22</code>.
If your section is 204, type <code>04</code>).

<!-- <p> Then you will see this: </p>

<pre>
Looking for files to turn in....
Submitting hw1.py.
Turn in ./MY.GMAILS? [yes/no]
</pre>

<p> Type either <code>yes</code> or <code>y</code> here.  Afterwards, you'll also be prompted about SECTIONS
and PARTNERS.  Type <code>yes</code> or <code>y</code> there as well. --> <p> Then you'll see: </p>

<pre>
Is this correct? [yes/no]
</pre>

<p> If any of the information above is incorrect, you have a chance to cancel your
submission here (type <code>no</code> or <code>n</code>).  However, don't worry too much because you can submit as many times
as you want before the deadline.  If it is correct, type <code>yes</code> or <code>y</code>.
To finish up, the system should output: </p>

<pre>
Submission complete.
</pre>

<p> A cool feature is that the second time you submit, your previous entries are saved as defaults.
You can escape retyping them (if the entries are what you want) by just typing <code>Enter</code>
to confirm the shown defaults. </p>

<h3 class="section_title">Few Simple Rules</h3>
<p>Here are some simple rules that you need to know to make sure all of your assignments get submitted properly.
<h4>Names</h4>
<p>
<code>submit</code> only accepts certain names for assignments, but they are easy to remember:
<ol>
    <li><code>hw#</code>, for each homework assignment.</li>
    <li><code>proj#</code>, for each project.</li>
</ol>
If you type in an incorrect name, <code>submit</code> will kindly remind you of all possible assignments.
</p>
<h4>Files</h4>
<p>
<code>submit</code> is only trained to look for certain files depending
upon the assignment. In CS61A, we will provide you all of the files
you will need to submit for each homework assignment and project.
If you try to change the name of the file that <code>submit</code> is
expecting (or the file isn't there), <code>submit</code> will let you
know what files need to be present for the submission to be successful.

<pre>
Looking for files to turn in....
Turn in ./interesting_file.something?  [yes/no] yes
You must turn in a file hw1.py for this assignment.
Here is the complete list of files you must turn in:
  hw1.py
Error: submission FAILED.
</pre>
If you have subdirectories (that is, a directory within a directory), then
<code>submit</code> will ask you whether or not you would like it to check those.
<pre>
nova [32] ~/hw1 # submit hw1
Looking for files to turn in....
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir? [yes/no] yes
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another? [yes/no] yes
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another/WHEN_WILL_IT_END? [yes/no] yes
Look at files in directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another/WHEN_WILL_IT_END/NOW? [yes/no] no
Skipping directory ./Another_Dir/And_Another/WHEN_WILL_IT_END/NOW.
Turn in ./interesting_file.something?  [yes/no] yes
Submitting hw1.py.
The files you have submitted are:
        ./hw1.py ./interesting_file.something
Is this correct? [yes/no] yes
Copying submission of assignment hw1....
Submission complete.
</pre>
</p>
<h3 class="section_title">Some Tips</h3>
<p>These will help you make the most effective use of <code>submit</code>.
<ol>
<li>
Remember that you tell <code>submit</code> the <em>name</em> of the
<strong>assignment</strong> you are submitting, <em>not</em> the current directory.
</li>
<li>
Whenever submit asks for [<code>yes</code>/<code>no</code>], typing in <code>y</code>
is equivalent to typing in <code>yes</code> (and similarly, <code>n</code>
for <code>no</code>).
</li>
<li>
While you may submit from your home directory (<code>~/</code>), it is
often best to create a separate folder for each assignment. This is
to avoid having <code>submit</code> ask you if you would like to submit
<em>every</em>, <em>single</em>, <em>file</em> in your current directory
(including all hidden files used by Unix for its own purposes). Keeping your
assignments organized by making separate directories for each assignment
will make your life easier (i.e. <code>proj1/</code>,
<code>hw1/</code>, etc.).
</li>
<li>
If you want to cancel a submission while <code>submit</code> is running,
issue the abort command with the key combination <code>Ctrl-C</code>.
</li>
<li>
Finally, our submission system allows for repeated submits. We will
always grade your <strong>last</strong> submission. Just make sure your last
submission is done before the assignment deadline!
</li>
</ol>

Remember, <code>submit</code> is a Unix program, so if you need any help
don't forget to check out
<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su12/lab/lab01/unix_emacs_tutorial/unix_emacs.html">our Unix Tutorial</a>
and
<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/connecting.html#file_transfers">information
on connecting to your CS61A account.</a> You can also get a brief description
of <code>submit</code> using the command <code>submit -h</code>.
</p>

<p>If you have any other questions about <code>submit</code> or anything else
CS61A related, don't forget to ask your friendly neighborhood staff or post on
